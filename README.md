- Search for employees by name  
- Sort employees by various attributes  
- Persistent storage using JSON  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python 3.x  
- JSON for data storage  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles  

## 📝 Usage Instructions
- Run Employee management system.py to access the menu.
